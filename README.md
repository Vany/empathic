## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd empathic

# Build release binary
make release

# Binary will be available at target/release/empathic
```

### System Requirements

- **Development**: macOS with Rust 1.87+
- **Deployment**: Ubuntu 24.10+ or equivalent Linux distribution
- **Dependencies**: Self-contained binary with no external runtime requirements

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
ROOT_DIR=/path/to/your/workspace

# Optional - Core
ADD_PATH=/additional/bin/paths  # Colon-separated additional PATH entries
LOGLEVEL=warn                   # Log level: debug, info, warn, error
LOGFILE=/path/to/logfile.log    # Optional: Write logs to file (stdout + file)

# Optional - LSP Integration (v2.0.0)
LSP_TIMEOUT=60                  # LSP request timeout in seconds
RA_LOG=warn                     # rust-analyzer log level: debug, info, warn, error  
LSP_RESTART_DELAY=2             # Restart delay in seconds for crashed LSP servers
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "empathic": {
      "command": "/path/to/empathic",
      "env": {
        "ROOT_DIR": "/Users/username/projects",
        "LOGLEVEL": "warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, empathic runs automatically when Claude Desktop starts. The server provides tools that Claude can invoke to:

- Read and write files in your workspace
- Execute development commands (git, cargo, npm, etc.)
- Navigate and search through project directories
- Perform text transformations and replacements
- Manage project build processes
- **🧠 NEW: Analyze Rust code with intelligent LSP-powered tools**
- **⚡ NEW: Get real-time diagnostics, completion, and navigation**

All operations are restricted to the configured `ROOT_DIR` for security.

### LSP Prerequisites

For LSP integration to work properly:

1. **Install rust-analyzer**: Available via PATH (e.g., through rustup)
   ```bash
   rustup component add rust-analyzer
   # OR via package manager
   # brew install rust-analyzer  # macOS
   # apt install rust-analyzer   # Ubuntu
   ```

2. **Rust projects**: LSP tools automatically detect Rust projects (containing `Cargo.toml`)

3. **Performance**: First LSP requests may take longer while rust-analyzer analyzes the project

## Development

### Build Commands

```bash
make build    # Debug build for development
make release  # Optimized production build
make test     # Run full test suite
make check    # Run linting and formatting checks
make clean    # Clean build artifacts
```

- **Slow operations** (workspace symbols): <2s ✅
- **Memory monitoring overhead**: <1ms per cycle ✅

### Security
- All operations restricted to configured workspace directory

## Logging

Empathic provides structured logging with configurable levels:

- **ERROR**: Tool failures and protocol errors
- **WARN**: Performance issues and fallback operations
- **INFO**: Tool executions and file operations
- **DEBUG**: Detailed protocol messages and internal state

Configure logging level with the `LOGLEVEL` environment variable.

### Log File Output

Optionally tee all log output to a file by setting the `LOGFILE` environment variable:

```bash
# Logs will be written to both stdout and the specified file
export LOGFILE=/var/log/empathic.log
```

The log file is opened in append mode, allowing logs to accumulate across server restarts. All log levels respect the `LOGLEVEL` or `RUST_LOG` setting.

## Troubleshooting

### LSP Integration Issues

#### rust-analyzer Not Found
```
Error: Failed to spawn rust-analyzer: No such file or directory
```
**Solution**: Install rust-analyzer and ensure it's in your PATH
```bash
# Via rustup (recommended)
rustup component add rust-analyzer

# Via package manager
brew install rust-analyzer      # macOS
apt install rust-analyzer       # Ubuntu
```

#### LSP Request Timeouts
```
Error: LSP request timed out after 60 seconds
```
**Solutions**:
- Increase timeout: `LSP_TIMEOUT=120`
- Wait for initial project analysis to complete
- Check rust-analyzer logs: `RA_LOG=debug`
- Verify project has valid `Cargo.toml`

#### Memory Issues
```
Warning: rust-analyzer exceeding memory limit, restarting...
```
**Solutions**:
- Monitor with: `empathic` will auto-restart high memory processes
- Large projects: Increase timeout `LSP_RESTART_DELAY=5`
- Exclude large directories in `.gitignore`

#### No LSP Features Available
```
Info: LSP tools available but no rust-analyzer features detected
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're in a Rust project directory (contains `Cargo.toml`)
- Check `ROOT_DIR` includes your Rust projects
- Verify `cargo check` works in the project
- Run `cargo build` to ensure project is valid

#### Performance Issues
```
Slow LSP responses, completion delays
```
**Solutions**:
- First-time analysis is slower (wait for completion)
- Check cache status in logs
- Monitor memory usage with system tools
- Consider smaller `ROOT_DIR` scope

### General Troubleshooting

#### File Operation Errors
```
Error: Operation failed outside ROOT_DIR
```
**Solution**: Ensure `ROOT_DIR` is set correctly and all target files are within it

#### Permission Issues
```
Error: Permission denied accessing file
```
**Solution**: Check file permissions and user access rights

#### Unicode Issues
```
Error: Invalid UTF-8 sequence
```
**Solution**: Ensure files are valid UTF-8 encoded

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
LOGLEVEL=debug RA_LOG=debug empathic
```

This will provide detailed information about:
- LSP server communication
- File operations and path resolution
- Performance metrics and cache operations
- Memory usage and resource monitoring
