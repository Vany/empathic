### Advanced Features
- **Pattern Matching**: Glob patterns, regex with capture groups, fuzzy matching
- **Gitignore Integration**: Automatic respect for .gitignore in recursive operations
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS and Ubuntu with platform-specific optimizations
- **Performance**: Optimized for typical development workflows

---

## 📊 Logging and Monitoring

### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed protocol messages, internal state
- **INFO**: Tool executions, file operations
- **WARN**: Performance issues, fallback operations  
- **ERROR**: Tool failures, protocol errors

### Log Format
```
[2025-07-11 15:30:45] INFO [write_file] Successfully wrote 1024 bytes to src/main.rs
[2025-07-11 15:30:46] ERROR [git] Command failed: git push origin main (exit code: 1)
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Standards
- **Unit Tests**: All core tool functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end MCP protocol scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Unicode, large files, concurrent access
- **Cross-Platform**: Both macOS and Ubuntu environments

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── common/              # Shared test utilities
├── read_file.rs         # ReadFileTool tests  
├── write_file.rs        # WriteFileTool tests
├── git_executor.rs      # Git command tests
├── env.rs               # Environment tests
└── integration_tests.rs # Cross-tool scenarios
```

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: >85% line coverage
- **Performance**: <100ms for typical file operations
- **Error Handling**: All failure modes tested
- **Unicode Support**: Comprehensive international text testing

## 🚀 Build and Development

### Build System (Makefile)
```makefile
build           # Debug build for development
release         # Optimized production build
test            # Run full test suite  
check           # Lint and format verification
clean           # Clean build artifacts
```

### Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.46", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0" 
unicode-segmentation = "1.12"
walkdir = "2.5"
regex = "1.10"
glob = "0.3"
ignore = "0.4"
```
